## CalculiX

### Description

CalculiX is a multi-platform calculator, available for macOS, Windows, Linux, Web, and Android. It is extremely efficient, lightweight, and runs natively in any environment, showcasing the full power of C.
The CalculiX calculator receives input data from the user as a string through a graphical interface. To return the result, the string passes through a chain of functions that, when analyzed individually, are simple, but together form a true production line that is, in a way, complex.
Each character in the analyzed string is passed through a conditional structure so that the program can identify the character and convert the entire string into a valid mathematical operation in C using the <math.h> library. The result is then obtained, converted back into a string, and returned to the graphical interface.
